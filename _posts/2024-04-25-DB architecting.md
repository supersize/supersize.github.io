# Two things you should take consideration on DB architecting.

1. Is there enough evidence to support the entity?

2. Can we effectively accommodate evolving requirements?


# processes of architecting DB tables.
1. top-down 
    When your prposal team complete their job, we can start analyzing entities. It takes time, but we can have enought evidence for our entities.

2. bottom-top
    You can be a copy cat for this. Top-down method is that you benchmark other big companies databases structures. Good point of this way is that you can 
    produce results quickly and you won't face huge DB architecture failure. However, it doesn't have enough evidence to support your tables. And, it's hard for you 
    to deal with problems when having additional demands from your customers.
