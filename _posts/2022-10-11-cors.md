> ### Simple requests
> - <b>simple request</b> is that a typical http request as we know.
> #### example
> Suppose you have this request, "https://foo.example" to a Server "https://bar.response"
> If  Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is " Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ", you will get 200 ok response.
> However, if it's not, you will not get the OK response.

> What if you are a person who can render the server side and want to allow "https://foo.example" request to your web application?
> you can set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example" in your Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

### Preflighted Request 
> Clients should send HTTP request to server with using OPTIONS(Client asks a server about what kinds of methods they accept.) method since it is important to know that the request is safe to send. The common things of the request are "Access-Control-Request-Method" , "Access-Control-Request-Headers".
> When the server got the request they response with information on header like "Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers"
