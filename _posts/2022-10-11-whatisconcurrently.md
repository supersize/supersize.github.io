#### I studyed about "how proxy server works". I summerize here what I learned not to forget and to remind!

### What is proxy?
> Basically, proxy is like a gateway bewtween you and the Internet. Proxy sever helps you to safely get the response that you requested as well as manage levels of functionality, security, and privacy dependinga on your ur use case, needs, and company policy.


### Why do we need proxy??
1. When you send web requests to sever, the proxy server forwards your web requests to your computer.

2. Proxy sever can offer a high level of privacy.
    > Firewell, web filter etc. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the bad stuff that lives out in the wild internet.

3. Proxy makes web requests on your behalf.
   > Computer on the internet has IP(Internet Protocol). A proxy server is fundamentally a computer on the internet with your IP address. When you send a requset, the requset goes to your proxy server fist and sent. And, the responses are collected first in proxy server before you see it from server.

4. You can control your internet for your kids or bussiness. 
   > What if your kids are fully exposed to violated or sexual contents? What if your employees are using the internet in an inappropriate way AKA "cyberloafing"? Proxy sever can deny access to some certain web sites 

5. Improving work efficiency and speed.
   > Proxy server can save the most requested url or something on the cache. So, when lots of people request a same url, a proxy server can send request only once to server. This saves bandwidth for the company and develop the network performance.

6. Improved security
   > You can configure ur proxy server to encrypt the web requests to keep prying eyes from reading your transactions. Also, you can prevent malware sites from any access through the proxy server. Further more, I think "VPN" is the most beneficial thing of using proxy server. VPN, Virtual Private Network, lets remote users have fully access to your network through your proxy. Remote users, who are provided with the fully access to your resource, can work with more secure connections. It's like "some countries refrain the people to access to pornhub! It's because the Govts or oganizations are controling the proxy server to ban any access to several web sites. 

### Any risk of using Proxy server?
1. Free proxy server is not safe! 
   > Some ppl living in countries that restrict access to the internet can't helpt using proxy servers. And, most of them tend to use "free proxy servers". But, the point of using them is they are passive to invest money for securities. Some proxy servers don't encrypt web requests. While the innocent are using them, some hackers or ppl with bad intentions could approach web requests very easily. In those web requests, lots of private information are involved such as "ID & PW", "keywords you searched for", or "websites you went".

2. History log still remain in the proxy server.
    > The Proxy server has your original IP address and web request information you sent. They are possible to be unencrypted locally. So, you have to check the policy of proxy sever you want to use.

3. Using proxy servers without encryption. 
   > If you use proxy server without encryotion..... I strongly recommend you need to stop using it!! Cuz it means your private information is fully exposed!!!

### What kinds of proxy servers are there?
1. Transparent proxy : it will still pass along your IP address, identifying you to the webserver for content filtering.
2. Anonymous Proxy : it won’t pass your IP address to the website – this helps prevent identity theft and keep your browsing habits private. They can also prevent a website from serving you targeted marketing content based on your location.
3. Distorting proxy : A distorting proxy server passes along a false IP address for you while identifying itself as a proxy.
4. High Anonymity proxy : High Anonymity proxy servers periodically change the IP address they present to the web server, making it very difficult to keep track of what traffic belongs to who.
