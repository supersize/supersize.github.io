## I got error when executing thumbnail making fucntion in my youtube project.
### Causes
1. I thought it was able to work cuz I checked I already installed it on my pakage.jon. But it didn't work cuz I should have installed ffmpeg in my computer first.

### Solved 
1. I installed it on my laptop by "brew install ffmpeg". It took about 3 mins to be done.
